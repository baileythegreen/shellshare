# shellshare
A Unix wrapper and a modified version of Vitor Baptista's Shellshare [https://github.com/vitorbaptista/shellshare](https://github.com/vitorbaptista/shellshare), that is useful for running remote programming tutorials when there might be several shellshare windows to keep track of.

This wrapper and the version of shellshare it calls ensures the URL will remain the same for the same user+system combination and writes the URL to a file for easy sharing and reference.
